## OH PANGINOON by Musikatha

---

```
O Panginoon, pinupuri Kita
Ako’y naririto upang sambahin Ka
Magpakailanman, Itataas Kita
Sa aking buhay Ikaw ang Dios

Chorus:
Ako’y nilikha, sadyang para Sa’yo
Lahat sa akin, Iaalay Sa’yo
Ang Iyong kaluguran, ang siyang nais ko
Maging kagalakan sa puso Mo
```

## The Power of Praise & Worship

> ***Acts 16:23-26*** “And when they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to keep them securely.
> (24) Having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.
> (25) But at midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.
> (26) Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were loosed.”

> 23 Pagkatapos hampasin nang paulit-ulit, sila'y ipinabilanggo at pinabantayang mabuti. 
> 24 Ipinasok sila ng bantay sa kaloob-looban ng bilangguan at inilagay ang kanilang mga paa sa pagitan ng dalawang mabibigat na kahoy.
> 25 Nang Maghahating-gabi na, sina Pablo at Silas ay nananalangin at umaawit ng mga himno, at nakikinig naman ang ibang mga bilanggo. 
> 26 Walang anu-ano'y lumindol nang malakas at nayanig pati ang mga pundasyon ng bilangguan. Biglang nabuksan ang mga pinto at nakalag ang mga tanikala ng lahat ng bilanggo.

## Praise Elevates us into God’s Presence and Power 
 ```
 Paul and Silas knew the secret of how to lift their hearts above their troubles and enter into God’s presence and power. Through praise and worship their hearts were raised into the joyous presence and peace of God, and provided God a channel for his power to operate in their circumstances.
 ```
 - God “dwells” in the atmosphere of His praise. (“For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them” (Matthew 18:20).)
 - Praise to God is a vehicle of faith which takes us into His presence and power!
 - Praise and worship is the “gate-pass” which allows us to enter the sacredness of His glory
 
 ## Question : What is Praise?
  - ***“This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me” (Matthew 15:8). Genuine praise to God is a matter of humility and sincere devotion to the Lord from within.***
  
 ## Praise to God is a Lifestyle
 - *** “...I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth” (Psalms 34:1). ***
 
 ## Praise Sends the Enemy Running
 
 ## NOTES
 
 - Kids will ask "WHY" while grown-ups will just wonder.
 - Worship is not a genre
 - worth-ship
