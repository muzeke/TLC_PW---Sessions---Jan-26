## OH PANGINOON by Musikatha

---

```
O Panginoon, pinupuri Kita
Ako’y naririto upang sambahin Ka
Magpakailanman, Itataas Kita
Sa aking buhay Ikaw ang Dios

Chorus:
Ako’y nilikha, sadyang para Sa’yo
Lahat sa akin, Iaalay Sa’yo
Ang Iyong kaluguran, ang siyang nais ko
Maging kagalakan sa puso Mo
```

## The Power of Praise & Worship

> ***Acts 16:23-26*** “And when they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to keep them securely.
> (24) Having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.
> (25) But at midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.
> (26) Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were loosed.”
